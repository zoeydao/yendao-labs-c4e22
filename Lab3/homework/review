1. Why should we use functions at all?
- function is a set of instructions and we should use functions 
when we want to operate that set of instructions repeatedly 

2. How to define/declare a function?
- def NAME_OF_FUNCTION( PARAMETERS ):
STATEMENTS

3. How to call/use a function?
NAME_OF_FUNCTION(PARAMETERS)

4. What is return, why and how do we use it?
- indicate what is returned from the function
- we use return for variables that we want to use outside the function
(because parameters in the funtion belong to the function scope and not in the global scope)

5. Do we have to use return in every function?
- No

6. What are function arguments/parameters, why and how we use it?
- The variables used in the function
for example: def draw_star(x,y,length) => x,y,length are parameters

7. How to use function from a different file other than our currently working file?
- to call a function from another module: from MODULE import FUNCTION
